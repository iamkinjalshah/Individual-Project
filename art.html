<h3>The Art</h3> 

    <H4 id="P1">LANDSCAPE & NATURE PHOTOGRAPHY GALLERY</H4>

    <p> A collection of breathtaking landscape photography by Kinjal Joshi from United States, Canada and India shows spaces within the world, sometimes vast and unending, but other times microscopic. Landscape photographs typically capture the presence of nature but can also focus on man-made features or disturbances of landscapes.</p>

<H4 id="P2">FINE ART & TRAVEL PHOTOGRAPHY GALLERY</H4>

<p> This is a collection of fine art photography by Kinjal Joshi presented in Panoramic as well as Portrait format. These formats are particularly well suited to spaces above a bed or sofa. All my panoramic print sizes are produced with a ratio of 2:1. The work found in this gallery and across the rest of this site is available produced in the form of limited edition prints, created using materials such as acrylic and aluminum.</p>
