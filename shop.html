<p>Welcome to my website and thank you for your interest in my work! The details below will educate you on everything you need to know about my art, the prints and the process from beginning to end when purchasing my photographs through this website. <br><br>

Although images do look nice on computer monitors, there is nothing quite like seeing a large print hanging on the wall. A print really helps to bring out detail and make the viewer feel like they were there. All my images are made with the final print in mind. Getting a print made really makes the image come alive. All images are available to be made into open-edition fine art prints.<br>

<br><br><b>Printing Process</b><br><br>

I take great pride in my work and each print is carefully printed to make sure that the print meets both my high standards and the clients. Each print is made with high quality, acid free ink and paper to ensure that your print keeps its vibrant colors for many years to come. For all prints 16"x24" and smaller, I offer professional prints with pigment inks on archival paper. The luster finish of these papers result in vibrant colors with minimal glare that is guaranteed to last for many years to come. For prints larger than 16"x24" I use a trusted lab to make high quality prints with a Lightjet printer that exposes the image on to traditional, highly archival photographic paper. If you would like a specific paper or printing process please contact me and I would be happy to accommodate you.<br><br></p>
